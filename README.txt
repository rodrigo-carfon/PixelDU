### DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO USE THE CODE ###
##########################################

The main code is in the mainpix.py file. It contains the main class of the crawler.
The runner.py file contains the parameters for the search, such as search phrase, section and type. 
Note that section and type are lists. Even if there is only one element on the list, it MUST be a list. 

Both mainpix.py and runner.py should stay in the same folder, and this same folder will receive the downloaded photos from the website.
